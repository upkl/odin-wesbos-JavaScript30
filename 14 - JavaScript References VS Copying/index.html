    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log({players, team});
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    console.log(players, team, team2, team3, team4, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {

    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(person, cap2);
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.number = 99
    console.log(person, cap3);
    

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
